ML Pipeline using FastAPI and PostgreSQL that automates the training and deployment of your sentiment analysis model. Here's what the complete system includes:
üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
Core Components:

FastAPI Backend - REST API for model interaction
PostgreSQL Database - Stores reviews, model versions, and training jobs
Redis - Task queue and caching
MLflow - Experiment tracking and model versioning
Automated Scheduler - Regular retraining and evaluation
AWS S3 Integration - Model storage and backup

üìã Key Features
1. Database Models

Reviews: Store reviews with sentiment predictions and manual labels
ModelVersions: Track different model versions with performance metrics
TrainingJobs: Monitor training job status and results

2. API Endpoints
Reviews (/reviews)

POST /reviews/ - Create review with automatic sentiment prediction
GET /reviews/ - Fetch reviews with filters
POST /reviews/{id}/label - Manually label reviews for training
POST /reviews/predict - Predict sentiment for any text

Training (/training)

POST /training/start - Start new training job
GET /training/status/{job_id} - Check training job status

Analytics (/analytics)

GET /analytics/dashboard - Dashboard statistics
GET /analytics/constructive-feedback - Business insights from constructive feedback

3. Automated ML Pipeline

Daily Retraining: Automatically retrain with new data at 2 AM
Weekly Evaluation: Assess model performance every Sunday
Auto-Deployment: Deploy better models automatically
Performance Monitoring: Track accuracy and trigger retraining when needed

4. Advanced Features

Constructive Feedback Analysis: Extract business insights
Model Versioning: Track and compare different model versions
Experiment Tracking: MLflow integration for experiment management
Cloud Storage: S3 integration for model storage
Background Tasks: Asynchronous training jobs

üöÄ Deployment Instructions
1. Setup Environment
bash# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd sentiment-ml-pipeline

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and AWS credentials
2. Database Setup
bash# Initialize database migrations
alembic init alembic
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
alembic upgrade head
3. Run with Docker
bash# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check services
docker-compose ps
4. Manual Setup
bash# Start PostgreSQL and Redis
# Update DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL in .env

# Run the application
python main.py
üíº Business Value
Automated Operations:

Zero-downtime retraining with new review data
Automatic model deployment when performance improves
Scheduled monitoring to catch performance degradation

Business Insights:

Constructive feedback identification for service improvements
Sentiment trend analysis over time
Performance analytics dashboard

Scalability:

Async processing for handling high-volume requests
Background job processing for training tasks
Cloud storage integration for model artifacts

üîß Usage Example
pythonimport requests

# Create a review
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/reviews/", json={
    "text": "Great food but service could be faster!",
    "source": "google",
    "rating": 4
})

print(response.json())
# Output: Predicted sentiment with confidence score

# Start training job
training_response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/training/start", json={
    "min_samples": 1000
})

# Get business insights
insights = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/analytics/constructive-feedback")
üìä Monitoring & Analytics
The system provides comprehensive monitoring through:

Real-time dashboards showing sentiment distribution
Model performance tracking with accuracy metrics
Training job monitoring with status updates
Business intelligence from constructive feedback

This complete ML pipeline ensures your sentiment analysis model stays current with fresh data while providing valuable business insights from customer feedback
