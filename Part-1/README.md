Text preprocessing and feature extraction

Creating feature tensors

Defining and training a PyTorch neural network

Architecture decisions (hidden layers, activation, softmax)

✅ Full working example

✅ Step-by-step Implementation


📘 Step 1: Sentiment Word Lists
Start by defining dictionaries of positive, negative, and optionally neutral words.


🧹 Step 2: Preprocessing and Tokenization
Convert to lowercase

Remove stopwords (NLTK or custom list)

Keep only meaningful words (filter punctuation/numbers)


📊 Step 3: Feature Extraction
Count how many words from each sentiment class appear in the text.


🔢 Step 4: Prepare Dataset for PyTorch


🧠 Step 5: Build the Neural Network (PyTorch)

Input: 7 features

Output: 4 classes (neg, pos, neu, cf)

Use Softmax for output probabilities

One or two hidden layers with ReLU are enough



🏋️ Step 6: Training Loop


🎯 Step 7: Prediction
