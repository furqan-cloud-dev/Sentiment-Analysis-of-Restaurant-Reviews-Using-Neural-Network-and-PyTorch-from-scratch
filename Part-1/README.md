# Build a sentiment analysis pipeline from scratch using PyTorch.


Text preprocessing and feature extraction

Creating feature tensors

Defining and training a PyTorch neural network

Architecture decisions (hidden layers, activation, softmax)

✅ Full working example

✅ Step-by-step Implementation


📘 Step 1: Sentiment Word Lists
Start by defining dictionaries of positive, negative, and optionally neutral words.


🧹 Step 2: Preprocessing and Tokenization
Convert to lowercase

Remove stopwords (NLTK or custom list)

Keep only meaningful words (filter punctuation/numbers)


📊 Step 3: Feature Extraction
Count how many words from each sentiment class appear in the text.


🔢 Step 4: Prepare Dataset for PyTorch


🧠 Step 5: Build the Neural Network (PyTorch)

Input: 7 features

Output: 4 classes (neg, pos, neu, cf)

Use Softmax for output probabilities

One or two hidden layers with ReLU are enough



🔸 Feature Classes (used as input signals):
negative

strongly negative

abusive

positive

strongly positive

neutral

constructive feedback

➡ 7-dimensional input feature vector

🔸 Output Classes (model prediction):
negative

positive

neutral

constructive feedback

➡ 4-class classification problem

✅ Summary

| Component         | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**         | 7 features (based on token match counts)            |
| **Hidden layers** | 2 hidden layers of 16 neurons each                  |
| **Output**        | 4 labels: negative, positive, neutral, constructive |
| **Loss Function** | `NLLLoss` (with `log_softmax`)                      |
| **Output Prob.**  | Yes, via `log_softmax` for interpretability         |
