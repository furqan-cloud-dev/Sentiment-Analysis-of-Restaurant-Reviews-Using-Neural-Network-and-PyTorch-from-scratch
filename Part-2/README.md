Great! Here's a complete end-to-end solution for building a sentiment analysis classifier for restaurant reviews using:

🔤 Manual feature extraction (positive/negative/constructive/neutral/abusive...)

🧠 PyTorch neural network

📦 Model training & saving

🚀 Google Colab deployment

🌐 FastAPI inference server



📁 Project Structure (Colab-friendly)

restaurant_sentiment/
├── train_model.py       # PyTorch model training + saving
├── sentiment_api.py     # FastAPI server for predictions
├── reviews.csv          # Labeled Google restaurant reviews



📘 Step 1: Prepare Dataset (reviews.csv)
We can start with this small sample and expand later.

text,label
"I love the food and service!",positive
"The place was dirty and the staff was rude.",negative
"Average food, but great ambiance.",neutral
"The waiter should check in more often.",constructive feedback
"The pizza was horrible, I hated it!",strongly negative
"Absolutely amazing experience. Loved everything!",strongly positive
"This was dumb and stupid service.",abusive
"Could improve the seating arrangement.",constructive feedback


🧠 Step 2: train_model.py – Train and Save the Model

🌐 Step 3: sentiment_api.py – FastAPI Server


🚀 Step 4: Deploy on Google Colab
🟢 Setup

!pip install fastapi uvicorn nest-asyncio pyngrok


🟢 Start API in Colab
import nest_asyncio
from pyngrok import ngrok
import uvicorn

# Start server
nest_asyncio.apply()
public_url = ngrok.connect(8000)
print("FastAPI running at:", public_url)

uvicorn.run("sentiment_api:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)


✅ Test Your API

curl -X POST http://<your-ngrok-url>/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "The service was amazing and food delicious!"}'

| Step | Action                                 |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Load a large restaurant review dataset |
| 2    | Preprocess & feature extraction        |
| 3    | Train PyTorch neural network (on GPU)  |
| 4    | Save the model                         |
| 5    | Deploy via FastAPI + pyngrok in Colab  |
